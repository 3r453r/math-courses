# Terms of Service

**Effective date:** February 18, 2026
**Version:** 1.0

## Welcome

StemForge is a learning platform where AI-generated courses are created, studied, and shared. By using StemForge, you agree to the following terms.

## 1. The Community Gallery

Courses created on the platform contribute to a shared learning library. Our team may feature courses in the public gallery to help learners discover great content. To maintain quality and relevance, our team curates gallery listings. Once a course is featured, it becomes part of the community collection.

## 2. Your Content

When you create a course on StemForge, the course content is generated by AI based on your topic and preferences. You retain the ability to manage, edit, export, and delete your courses at any time.

By using StemForge, you grant us a non-exclusive, worldwide license to display, reproduce, and distribute your courses through the platform, including in the public gallery. This license allows us to operate and improve the platform for the benefit of all learners.

## 3. Attribution

You can claim credit for your courses at any time. When you claim authorship, your display name appears alongside your featured work in the gallery. You can also remove your attribution at any time — it's your choice.

## 4. Gallery Preferences

You can indicate whether you'd like a course to be considered for the gallery. We generally respect this preference as part of our commitment to your experience. However, to keep the gallery thriving, our team retains the ability to feature any course that meets quality standards.

## 5. Your Account

You are responsible for maintaining the security of your account and any API keys you provide. StemForge stores API keys encrypted on our servers but cannot guarantee absolute security.

## 6. Acceptable Use

You agree not to:
- Use the platform to generate harmful, illegal, or misleading content
- Attempt to disrupt the platform's operation or other users' experience
- Share or distribute API keys that don't belong to you
- Circumvent access controls or rate limits

## 7. Availability and Changes

StemForge is provided "as is." We may modify, suspend, or discontinue features at any time. We'll make reasonable efforts to notify you of significant changes.

We may update these terms from time to time. When we do, we'll ask you to review and accept the updated version before continuing to use the platform.

## 8. Limitation of Liability

StemForge is an educational tool. Course content is AI-generated and may contain errors. We are not liable for decisions made based on course content, for any loss of data, or for interruptions in service.

## 9. Contact

If you have questions about these terms, reach out to us through our Discord community or the contact information on our website.
